**Appendix B: Reproducibility and Code**
This repository contains the supplementary code, data, and documentation for Appendix B of our paper. It is intended to ensure full transparency and reproducibility of the computational methods, simulations, and statistical analyses underlying our key findings.

- Overview
The research explores the hypotheses of the IIM (Integrative Information Model) using a combination of in silico simulations and empirical data. Our methodology spans quantum computing simulations, machine learning, Bayesian modeling, and bioinformatics pipelines.

- Methods and Models
We employed a range of advanced techniques across different domains:

- Biological & Statistical Models
Bayesian Model Comparison for hypothesis testing

Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling for joint inference

Polynomial & Random Forest Regressions for predictive modeling

Monte Carlo Simulations for theoretical confirmation

- Computational Simulations
Discrete 4-Qubit Simulations using quantum-inspired models

Continuous-variable Models to explore nonlinear dynamics

- Bioinformatics Pipeline
Custom pipeline built on:

OrthoFinder

IQ-TREE

MAFFT

Executed via a scalable cloud computing platform
