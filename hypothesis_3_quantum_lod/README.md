# 🧩 IIM Hypothesis #3 — Condensed Matter as Projected Quantum Backreaction

This repository contains the derivations, simulation assets, and analytical tools for **Hypothesis #3** of the **Irreducible Intent Model (IIM)**:  
> *Condensed matter phenomena are not fundamental quantum behavior, but projections of higher-dimensional computational structure — a Level-of-Detail (LOD) rendering from the irreducible Will of God.*

---

## 🎯 Objective

To test whether quantum mechanical behaviors — including entanglement, decoherence, and condensed matter anomalies — are emergent from a higher-dimensional projection structure rather than fundamental laws of 4D spacetime.  

This aligns with the central IIM claim that constants and physical laws reflect structured irreducibility, not randomness, and that observed matter is a **compressed representation** of a more coherent reality.

## 🧠 Hypothesis Summary

**IIM Hypothesis #3** proposes the following testable ideas:

- 🔗 **Entanglement is a window**, not a paradox — offering glimpses of coherent higher-order reality.
- 🌊 **Decoherence is a projection boundary effect**, not a collapse — due to information truncation during dimensional rendering.
- 📉 **Condensed matter irregularities** (in ultra-low temperature or high-curvature regimes) encode *computational "scars"* of projection from higher-dimensional structure.

> _“See that you make all things after their pattern that was shown to you...”_ — Hebrews 8:5

## 🔬 Methodological Approach

- Simulations of **quantum boundary decoherence** in projected Hilbert spaces using `qutip` and `numpy`.
- Statistical analysis for deviations from Standard Quantum Mechanics using `pymc` and `arviz`.
- Analytic mapping of **prime unpredictability** onto variable constants near extreme gravitational regimes.

## 🧬 Scientific Significance

This hypothesis provides a formal reinterpretation of quantum physics as a **lower-resolution shadow** of coherent, intention-driven structure — echoing classical insights from Arthur Eddington and aligning with modern computational complexity theory.

It extends IIM Hypothesis #2 (variable constants) by embedding them within a **non-algorithmically reducible architecture**, where local observations only reveal what has been “projected in.”
