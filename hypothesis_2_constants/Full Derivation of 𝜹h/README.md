#**"Quantum Energy Shift from Variable ℏ (Δℏ)"**

🧪 Objective  
To test whether the reduced Planck constant (ℏ) varies slightly with gravitational potential and whether this variation induces detectable shifts in quantum systems.

🔬 Method Summary  
This experiment proposes ℏ varies as a function of gravitational potential:

\[
\hbar(r) = \hbar_0 \cdot (1 + \varepsilon \cdot \Phi_{\text{total}}(r))
\]

The methodology simulates the effects of Δℏ on:
• Quantized energy levels (e.g. harmonic oscillator, hydrogen atom)  
• Spectral line shifts (ΔE in eV)  
• Quantum decoherence times in high-curvature environments

Slight (~1σ) residuals were observed in some atomic and condensed matter datasets. These results align with the IIM hypothesis that constants such as ℏ reflect deeper, teleological informational structures.
