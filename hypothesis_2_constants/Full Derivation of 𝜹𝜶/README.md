# Δα/α Simulation — Variable Fine-Structure Constant

This folder contains the derivation, simulation, and data outputs for the experiment:

**"Black Hole Spectral Shift from Variable α (Δα/α)"**, supporting Hypothesis #2 of the Irreducible Intent Model (IIM).

---

## 🧪 Objective

To test whether the fine-structure constant α varies with gravitational potential in extreme environments, such as the accretion disks surrounding black holes.
