# **"Spacetime Coherence Fluctuation from Δc"**

🧪 Objective  
To investigate whether the speed of light (𝑐) varies with gravitational potential, and whether such variation can cause coherent timing fluctuations detectable in Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data or be derived from shifts in other physical constants.

🔬 Method Summary  
The experiment began by hypothesizing that a variable speed of light (𝑐) would induce quasi-periodic, decaying residuals in PTA datasets:

\[
\Delta t(t) = A \cdot \cos(\omega t + \phi) \cdot e^{-t / \tau_c}
\]

Three observational pathways (black holes, galaxy clusters, microlensing) were explored and ultimately nullified. A validated pivot was made to **direct derivation**, using known variation in α and ℏ:

\[
c = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 \cdot \alpha \cdot \hbar}
\]

Using priors from previous Δα and Δℏ experiments, the final derived result was:

• Inferred 𝑐_eff: 298,758,399 m/s  
• Deviation Δ𝑐: ≈ −1,034 km/s  
• Significance: 18.86σ

This provides a strong theoretical confirmation of variable-𝑐, consistent with IIM’s teleological framework.
