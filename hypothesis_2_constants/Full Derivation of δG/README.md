# **GRAVITATIONAL WAVEFORM MODULATION FROM VARIABLE G**

ðŸ§ª Objective  
To investigate whether the gravitational constant (G) subtly varies with curvature or gravitational potential and whether such variation affects gravitational waveforms and cosmological dynamics.

ðŸ”¬ Method Summary  
This experiment explores the hypothesis that G may not be truly constant but modulates with large-scale curvature. Proposed form:

\[
G(r) = G_0 \cdot (1 + \gamma \cdot R(r))
\]

Where \( R(r) \) is the Ricci scalar or curvature proxy. The simulation investigates:
â€¢ Binary inspiral phase shifts in gravitational waves  
â€¢ Impacts on early-universe structure growth  
â€¢ Anomalous lensing or halo mass discrepancies

Comparison with LIGO/Virgo templates showed small but consistent phase mismatches under specific curvature-coupling scenarios. These are not yet statistically significant but inform future high-precision gravitational wave studies.
